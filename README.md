# Superstore Profitability Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Superstore’s data to uncover opportunities for boosting profitability and minimizing losses. By examining profit centers, loss-makers, advertising effectiveness, and product return rates, the analysis delivers actionable insights to support data-driven strategic decision-making.

## Dataset

This analysis uses the Superstore.xls dataset, which includes detailed information on orders, product categories, shipping modes, regions, and returns. The Orders and Returns tables were joined and calculated fields were created to evaluate profitability and return behavior. Note: The original Tableau workbook used for visualizations became corrupted, so some visualizations may need to be rebuilt if replication is needed.
